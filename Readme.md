# Project Description

Team is asked by a start-up company to develop a software system which
provides roadside assistant services. These services provide assistance
to motorists whose vehicles have suffered a mechanical failure
(e.g. flat batteries, flat tyres, towing, locked out or emergency fuel
delivery) that leaves the driver stranded on the road. Customers can
choose either:

• Membership subscription -- customers will pay a fixed membership fee
annually and are entitled to unlimited roadside assistance callouts.
This is similar to NRMA services.

• Pay-on-demand -- customers will pay per service use. When the need
emerges (e.g. their car broke down), they will request assistance
through the system. Prices are calculated and presented to customers up
front. This is similar to Uber-style but for roadside assistance.

The company is building up its nationwide network of qualified roadside
assistance professionals who also use the system to manage jobs (service
callouts) and payments. The company is also recruiting new roadside
assistance professionals who are able to register for joining using the
same system.

Once a customer (motorist) makes a service request, it will be
broadcasted to all the registered professionals who are available and
capable to provide this service in nearby area (e.g. within 50 kms).
They will receive information about the problematic vehicle
(e.g. location, plate number, model, etc.), instructions and payment via
the system. They can then decide whether they accept the request. The
customer can see how many responders are in the area via the system and
which one accepts their request. Once the service is completed, the
customer can rate and review it using the system). Payment will be
deducted from their credit card and will be credited to the
professional's account (after a certain commission fee is taken).

The system supports the following key goals ( can be discuss with the
detailed and specific requirements): 
• Manage customer memberships including types of users, user profiles and subscriptions.
• Manage roadside assistance professionals 
• Manage road assistance service requests 
• Manage payment transactions 
• Manage reviews and ratings
• Manage report generation (e.g. payment reports, service reports, etc.)

Create test data that is sufficiently large enough to simulate the
system (e.g. at minimum 20 motorists, 100 roadside assistance
professionals and 20 service requests and transactions). A script to
randomly generate these data.
